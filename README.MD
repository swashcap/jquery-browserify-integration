# jquery-browserify-integration
In your app you are:
- trying to use jQuery.
- trying to use browserify.
- trying to use jQuery plugins.

All at the same time?!?!  IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE?

Well sure.

# how do i do it?
See the `main.js` file.  If you want to fiddle with how this all works (perhaps try adding your plugins, widgets, and gidgets!), clone the repo and run `npm run demo`.  This will boot a [beefy server](http://didact.us/beefy/) in order to browserify the demo code and let you load it in the browser directly.  **Rad!**
